  I enjoy discovering and using technologies that make communication of data easier and more effective. Data visualization and data application development are my main interests and I am always looking for new technologies to communicate data insights in effective ways. 
  
  I am an avid R programmer and most of my work is done using R, although I like to use web based technologies as well. Much of this site's content includes R, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript for the purpose of sharing my knowledge and experience with others, and reinforcing the things I have learned for myself.  
  
  Happy learning!
