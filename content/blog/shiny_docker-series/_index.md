    This series focuses on how to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to package your [R Shiny](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/) 
    application in a container, so that you can host your app more easily on a cloud server. 
    
    I will show my process for dockerizing these apps in multiple different ways, and
    then how to host them using [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).
    As the series progresses, I may decide to explore other cloud platforms.
