  description: "You'll find posts about a variety of topics, although I frequently like to explore new data visualization packages and 
  show examples of how they can be used. \n\nI also like to explore the use of HTML and CSS in R. This is because most R users are uncomfortable      with these technologies when they really shouldn't be! \n\nI believe R useres are perfectly suited to incorporate them into the data                visualizations since they open up a wide range of possibilities for presenting data.

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
