## echarts4r : An Overview

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[*echarts4r*](https://echarts4r.john-coene.com/index.html) is by far one of, if not the most, powerful graphing libraries for interactive data visualizations in R that I have come across. Of course, there are many other libraries that provide interactive functionality for data visualizations, like [*highcharter*](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/), developed by [Joshua Kunst](https://jkunst.com/) and [*plotly*](https://plotly.com/r/). There is also [*dygraphs*](https://rstudio.github.io/dygraphs/), a great interactive data viz library for time series (something I am particular passionate about). And of course, we could not talk about interactive graphing without mentioning the incredible geospatial plotting library [*Leaflet*](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).

As great as *highcharter* is, it does require a license in order to use the library commercially. *Leaflet* and *dygraphs* are both specific to certain types of graphs, even if they do VERY well at what they advertise. *Plotly* is powerful, and many will point out that it is the best general purpose interactive graphing library available for free. It’s that good. However, I maintain that *echarts4r* is my favorite interactive graphing library in most situations because it provides nearly as much functionality, if not equally as much, as *plotly* and, well, it just looks better!

Of course this is my preference. Someone else would prefer *plotly* because they greatly value the simplicity and clarity of it, or for some other reason that I have neglected to mention. But I love *echarts4r*’s style. It looks good, performs well, and provides a great user experience without compromising its ability to effectively communicate data. And, it’s easy to use!

Here are a few examples to wet your tongue.
