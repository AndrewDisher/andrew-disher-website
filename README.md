# Welcome to my website!

## A friendly message

I created this website to better showcase the data analytics projects that I have been working on. 
GitHub is a great place to do that, however it does have some limitations and sometiems a website
is just more user friendly to explore and read about things. 

If you're interested in any of my projects here on GitHub, feel free to visit my website and learn more about 
the motivation for my projects. I also have a blog that that focuses primarily on data visualization with R and 
its massive ecosystem of packages. So, if you are interested in incorporating web development tools like HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript in R and you've got some spare time, feel free to check out some of my posts. I'd really 
appreciate it, and any feedback that you might have! ðŸ˜ƒ 

## How was it made???

I have to thank [Allison Hill](https://apero--apreshill.netlify.app/) and her collaberators for creating the amazing [Hugo Apero](https://github.com/hugo-apero/) theme. Hugo themes are essentially
website templates that can be implemented with typical web development tools (HTML, etc.) or even R! I chose to use R so that
I could incorporate .RMarkdown files to better showcase my work in blogposts, since my interests largely revolve around 
effective data visualization. I chose Hugo Apero because it's an incredible theme, simple, and lets me focus on my work, rather 
than fixing my website's configuration all the time. 

## Some links to resources

If you are interested in creating personal websites in R, I would reccomend checking out the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package, 
created by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/) and others. If you choose blogdown as your website creation tool, there is also the 
[Creating Websites with R Markdown Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), which is sure to help a lot. One last resource I'll share 
is Allison Hill's incredible [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RksaNh5Ywbo&ab_channel=R-LadiesTunis) on YouTube, 
in which she demos Hugo Apero and its many great features. She has a lot of videos on Hugo Apero, but I found this to be the most concise one that
helped me a lot!
